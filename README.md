This is a basic chess game implemented in Python using Pygame. It features an 8x8 board, starting piece positions, mouse-based selection and movement, and simplified move validation (e.g., pawns, knights, bishops, rooks, queens, kings have basic rules, but no path blocking checks, castling, en passant, or check/checkmate detection for simplicity). White moves first, and turns alternate. Pieces are represented using Unicode chess symbols.

To run it, ensure Pygame is installed (pip install pygame), then execute the script. Click a piece to select it (highlights in yellow), then click a destination to move. If you want enhancements like full rule validation, AI opponent, or sounds, let me know! Note: This uses a font that supports Unicode chess symbols (Segoe UI Symbol on Windows; may vary on other OS). If pieces don't display, you might need to adjust the font.
